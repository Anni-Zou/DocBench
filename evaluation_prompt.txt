Task Overview:
You are tasked with evaluating user answers based on a given question, reference answer, and additional reference text. Your goal is to assess the correctness of the user answer using a specific metric.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Yes/No Questions: Verify if the user's answer aligns with the reference answer in terms of a "yes" or "no" response.
2. Short Answers/Directives: Ensure key details such as numbers, specific nouns/verbs, and dates match those in the reference answer.
3. Abstractive/Long Answers: The user's answer can differ in wording but must convey the same meaning and contain the same key information as the reference answer to be considered correct.

Evaluation Process:
1. Identify the type of question presented.
2. Apply the relevant criteria from the Evaluation Criteria.
3. Compare the user's answer against the reference answer accordingly.
4. Consult the reference text for clarification when needed.
5. Score the answer with a binary label 0 or 1, where 0 denotes wrong and 1 denotes correct.
NOTE that if the user answer is 0 or an empty string, it should get a 0 score.
